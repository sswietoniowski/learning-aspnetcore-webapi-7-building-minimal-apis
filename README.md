# Learning ASP.NET Core - WebAPI (.NET 7) Building Minimal APIs

This repository contains examples showing how to building a minimal API (WebAPI 7).

Based on this course [Building ASP.NET Core 7 Minimal APIs](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/asp-dot-net-core-7-building-minimal-apis/table-of-contents).

Original course materials can be found [here](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/asp-dot-net-core-7-building-minimal-apis/exercise-files) and [here](https://github.com/KevinDockx/BuildingAspNetCore7MinimalAPIs).

## Setup

To run API:

```cmd
cd .\contacts\backend\api
dotnet restore
dotnet ef database update
dotnet build
dotnet watch run
```

## Introduction to ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs

To create a new minimal API project, just choose the "Web API" template in Visual Studio or use the `dotnet new webapi` command like so (just an example):

```cmd
dotnet new webapi --framework net7.0 --language C# --no-https false --auth None --use-minimal-apis true --use-program-main false --output "." --force
```

To test your project you can use:

- :+1: [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) - especially useful for testing REST APIs as presented [here](https://youtu.be/zp5Jh2FIpF0),
- [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/),
- [curl](https://curl.se/),
- :+1: [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) - my personal favorite as I am a big fan of Visual Studio Code,
- [RESTer](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/rester/) (Firefox Add-on),
- ... and many more.

If you are using Visual Studio or JetBrains Rider you can use the built-in tools. Latest versions of Visual Studio have built-in support for testing REST APIs, more on that [here](https://youtu.be/ud0wx5mgniI).

I'd like to concentrate on the new/different features of the minimal APIs in .NET 7, so I started with an existing code for my domain classes, DTOs, database contexts, etc. What I'll be using as my example will be a simple API for managing contacts.

As this project is using .NET 7 and C# 11, I've decided to try out new language features provided by the latest version of C#. One of them is `required` keyword for properties (+ `[SetsRequiredMembers]` attribute), more on that [here](https://youtu.be/_hQPSOocXs0).
